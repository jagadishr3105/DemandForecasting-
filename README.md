# Demand Forecasting Project

## Overview
This project focuses on demand forecasting for FMCG (Fast-Moving Consumer Goods) products. The dataset used is publicly available and contains information about various products we encounter in daily life. By analyzing past trends and patterns, this project aims to predict demand for the upcoming year, enabling better inventory planning and supply chain efficiency.

## Dataset Details
The dataset includes the following columns:
- **Category**: The category to which the product belongs.
- **Price**: The price of the product.
- **Sales Volume**: Historical sales data.
- **Supplier Cost**: The cost incurred by suppliers.
- **Replenishment Lead Time**: The time taken to restock the product.
- **Stock Level**: Current stock levels.
- **Promotion**: Indicators for promotional activities.
- **Weekday**: The day of the week the sales occurred.

## Goal of the Analysis
The primary objective is to predict the demand for listed products for the next year. Accurate demand forecasting can help supply chain analysts and businesses optimize inventory, reduce waste, and meet customer demands efficiently.

## Methodology
In this project, an ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model was used for time series forecasting. Here’s why this model was chosen:
- **Trend Analysis**: ARIMA effectively captures trends and seasonality in the data.
- **Stationarity Handling**: ARIMA’s differencing step helps in making non-stationary data stationary, a common requirement in time-series forecasting.
- **Simplicity and Interpretability**: ARIMA is a straightforward yet powerful model that provides a good starting point for demand forecasting.

### Steps Followed
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Identified and handled missing values using appropriate imputation techniques.
   - Checked for outliers and applied transformations where necessary to ensure data quality.
   - Aggregated data as needed for the time-series model (e.g., grouping by week or month).
   - Verified stationarity using statistical tests like the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test and applied differencing where required.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualized historical trends, seasonality, and patterns using time-series plots.
   - Examined the effects of variables like promotions and weekdays on sales.
3. **Model Selection and Fitting**:
   - Selected ARIMA as the baseline model based on data characteristics.
   - Tuned model parameters (p, d, q) using automated techniques like grid search.
   - Evaluated model performance using metrics such as AIC (Akaike Information Criterion).
4. **Forecasting**:
   - Predicted future demand using the fitted ARIMA model.
   - Visualized the forecast and compared it with historical trends.

## Key Outcomes
- The ARIMA model provided a baseline demand forecast for the next year.
- Seasonal patterns and trends were identified, aiding in better understanding of demand fluctuations.

## Future Enhancements
This project is just the beginning. Several improvements and extensions are planned to make the forecasting more robust and insightful:
- **Incorporating Advanced Models**: Future iterations will include models like Prophet and SARIMA to account for complex seasonality and external factors.
- **Adding External Variables**: Integrating additional variables like weather data, economic indicators, or competitive pricing could enhance forecast accuracy.
- **Improving Visualizations**: Creating interactive dashboards for real-time monitoring of forecasted demand.

## Why This Matters
Accurate demand forecasting is crucial for supply chain analysts, data scientists, and businesses aiming to optimize operations. By predicting future demand, stakeholders can make informed decisions about inventory management, pricing strategies, and resource allocation.

## How You Can Contribute
This project is a work in progress, and contributions are welcome! Here’s how you can help:
- Suggest additional models or methodologies to improve forecasting.
- Share insights on how external factors could be incorporated into the analysis.
